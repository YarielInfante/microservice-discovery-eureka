The Config Server needs to know which repository to manage. There are several choices here, but weâ€™ll use a Git-based filesystem repository. You could as easily point the Config Server to a Github or GitLab repository, as well. On the file system, create a new directory and git init it. Then add a file called a-bootiful-client.properties to the Git repository. Make sure to also git commit it, as well. Later, you will connect to the Config Server with a Spring Boot application whose spring.application.name property identifies it as a-bootiful-client to the Config Server. This is how the Config Server will know which set of configuration to send to a specific client. It will also send all the values from any file named application.properties or application.yml in the Git repository. Property keys in more specifically named files (like a-bootiful-client.properties) override those in application.properties or application.yml.
